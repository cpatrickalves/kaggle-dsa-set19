# Data Science Academy kaggle Competition

This project presents a code/kernel used in a Kaggle competition promoted by [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/) in **September of 2019**.

The goal of the competition was to create a Machine Learning model to help a robot to classify the floor surface on which it is using data collected by Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensors.

About the project: The data used in this competition was collected by the **Tampere University Signal Processing Department in Finland**. Data collection was performed with a small mobile robot equipped with IMU sensors on different floor surfaces at the university premises. The task is to predict which of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete, etc.) the robot is using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity. The success of this competition will help improve the navigation of autonomous robots on many different surfaces.
